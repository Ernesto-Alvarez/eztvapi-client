# eztvapi-client
client for eztvapi.re

Rough project plan

Version 0.1.0: create an eztvapi client. Must work and nothing else (done!)
Version 0.2.0: redesign all classes to be elegant and properly named.
Version 0.3.0: reliability. Eztvapi is notoriously unreliable. Create a client that retries and can add data as it appears.
Version 0.4.0: cache. Create a compatible class that gets data from local storage and make the client search there first, Strive to only get deltas from exztvapi.
Version 0.5.0: proof of concept on PC.
Version 1.0.0: program operating on raspbmc
